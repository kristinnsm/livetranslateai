## 🎯 Next Steps (Days 2-9)

### Day 2: Core Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Setup: Install FFmpeg, create .env, run test_connection.py
- [ ] Start backend and verify health endpoint
- [ ] Open frontend and test WebSocket connection
- [ ] **Test audio capture**: Verify chunks streaming (Network tab)
- [ ] **Measure latency**: Log timestamps, aim for 3-5s traditional mode
- [ ] Debug any connection issues

**Success Criteria**:
- Backend starts without errors
- WebSocket connects (green status dot)
- Audio chunks visible in Network tab
- Console shows "WebSocket connected"

---

### Day 3: Translation Accuracy
- [ ] Speak 10 test phrases (clear audio)
- [ ] Compare `originalText` to what you said
- [ ] Calculate Word Error Rate (WER): aim for 85%+
- [ ] Test translation quality (natural tone?)
- [ ] Check latency: should be <5s per phrase
- [ ] Test VAD: verify silence is filtered

**Test Phrases**:
1. "Hello, my name is [Your Name]"
2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
3. "How are you doing today?"
4. "I would like a cup of coffee please"
5. "What time is the meeting?"

**Success Criteria**:
- 85%+ WER on transcription
- Natural-sounding translations
- Latency <5s (traditional) or <1s (realtime)

---

### Day 4-5: Replay Feature
- [ ] After 30s conversation, click "Replay Last Minute"
- [ ] Verify audio concatenation (no gaps/skips)
- [ ] Check subtitle sync (±200ms tolerance)
- [ ] Test replay durations (30s, 60s, 2min)
- [ ] Verify WebVTT format validity
- [ ] Test replay on empty buffer (should show toast error)

**Success Criteria**:
- Replay audio plays smoothly
- Subtitles appear at correct timestamps
- No crashes on empty/short buffers

---

### Day 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] **No microphone**: Block permissions → check toast message
- [ ] **Network offline**: Disconnect WiFi → check "Reconnecting..." message
- [ ] **API rate limit**: Rapid requests → verify retry logic
- [ ] **Noisy audio**: Play background music → VAD should filter
- [ ] **Empty replay**: Immediate replay → check error handling
- [ ] **WebSocket disconnect**: Kill backend → check auto-reconnect

**Success Criteria**:
- Graceful error messages (no crashes)
- Auto-reconnect works
- Retries succeed after transient failures

---

### Day 7: Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] **Chrome** (primary): Full test suite
- [ ] **Firefox**: Test WebRTC compatibility
- [ ] **Safari** (if Mac): Test audio permissions
- [ ] Add `adapter.js` if Safari fails
- [ ] Mobile test (optional): Chrome on Android

**Success Criteria**:
- Works on 2+ browsers
- Mobile-responsive UI
- No console errors

---

### Day 8: Optimization & Polish
- [ ] Review latency logs → identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Try Realtime API mode (if not already)
- [ ] Tune VAD aggressiveness (test 0-3)
- [ ] Improve subtitle styling (font size, positioning)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (Space = Start/Stop?)
- [ ] Polish UI animations

---

### Day 9: Deployment & Demo
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render
  - Add OPENAI_API_KEY in dashboard
  - Test deployed health endpoint
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel
  - Update `wsUrl` in app.js to production
  - Test CORS headers
- [ ] **Full production test**: End-to-end demo
- [ ] Share link with friend for feedback
- [ ] Record demo video (30s clip)

**Success Criteria**:
- Production site works end-to-end
- Shareable demo link
- Positive user feedback

## 📋 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Audio-only**: No video feed yet
- **1:1 simulation**: Loopback testing (not true peer-to-peer)
- **Language pairs**: Focus on EN↔ES for highest accuracy
- **Realtime API**: May need adjustment based on OpenAI API availability
- **Buffer export**: No MP4 download yet (audio + VTT only)

### Expected Challenges
1. **Latency tuning**: May need multiple iterations to hit <5s
2. **Accent handling**: Non-native speakers may have lower WER
3. **Background noise**: May need stricter VAD settings
4. **WebSocket stability**: Some environments block WebSockets
5. **OpenAI rate limits**: Free tier may throttle during testing

---

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### High Latency (>10s)
```bash
# Check mode
grep USE_REALTIME_API .env

# Try traditional mode
USE_REALTIME_API=false

# Check OpenAI status
curl https://status.openai.com
```

### WebSocket Won't Connect
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(websocket.readyState)
// 0 = CONNECTING, 1 = OPEN, 2 = CLOSING, 3 = CLOSED

// Check backend logs
# Look for: "📞 New session: session_..."
```

### Poor Transcription Quality
```bash
# Increase VAD aggressiveness
VAD_AGGRESSIVENESS=3

# Test in quiet environment
# Use headphones (avoid echo)
```

### Audio Playback Issues
```javascript
// Check AudioContext state
console.log(audioContext.state)
// Should be "running"

// Resume if suspended
audioContext.resume()
```
