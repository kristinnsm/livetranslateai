## 🚫 **What NOT to Do**

### **Avoid These Common Mistakes:**

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Instead |
|-----------|-----------|
| Post "Check out my product!" on Reddit | Share a helpful resource, mention product in comments |
| Mass DM potential customers | Personalized outreach with specific value prop |
| Launch and disappear | Daily engagement for first 90 days |
| Target everyone | Focus on 2-3 specific niches |
| Obsess over features | Talk to customers, understand pain points |
| Wait for perfection | Ship now, improve based on feedback |
| Ignore early users | Over-deliver on support (they're your advocates) |

---

## 📈 **Metrics to Track Daily**

### **Dashboard (Simple Spreadsheet):**

| Date | Signups | Trials Started | Paid Conversions | MRR | Churn | Notes |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------|-----|-------|-------|
| 11/8 | 12 | 5 | 1 | $29 | 0 | Product Hunt launch |
| 11/9 | 8 | 3 | 0 | $29 | 0 | Reddit post in r/languagelearning |

## 💪 **Mindset for $0-Budget Growth**

### **Remember:**

**It's a marathon, not a sprint.**
- Most "overnight successes" took 2-3 years
- First 100 customers are the hardest
- After that, it gets easier (word-of-mouth kicks in)

**Focus on quality over quantity.**
- 10 passionate customers > 100 lukewarm users
- They become your sales team

**Show up every day.**
- 2 hours/day for 90 days = 180 hours
- That's one full month of work
- Consistency beats intensity

**Solve problems, don't pitch.**
- Lead with value
- Your product is the solution, not the conversation

**Build relationships, not transactions.**
- Your early customers are your co-founders
- They'll shape your product
- Treat them like gold
