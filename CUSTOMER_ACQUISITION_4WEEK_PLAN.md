## **📅 WEEK 1: LAUNCH & BUILD MOMENTUM**

### **DAY 1 (MONDAY) - LAUNCH DAY**

#### **🔵 LinkedIn (9 AM):**
```
🚀 Just launched my first SaaS product

Background: I run an import/export business. Was paying $80/hour for Spanish interpreters on Zoom calls.

After the 6th call this month ($480 wasted), I thought: "There has to be a better way."

Spent the last 2 weeks building LiveTranslateAI - real-time AI translation for business calls.

✅ Works on any video platform
✅ 15 languages supported
✅ $29/month vs $80/hour interpreters

Already saved myself $450 this month. Now making it available to others.

If you work with international clients/suppliers, what's your biggest language barrier challenge?

🧵 I just shipped my first SaaS in 2 weeks

The problem: Paying $80/hour for interpreters on business calls with Spanish suppliers

The solution: Real-time AI translator for video calls

Here's what I learned building @LiveTranslateAI 👇

(1/8)

The wake-up call:

Invoice from last month: $480 in interpreter fees
For only 6 calls

That's when I realized: AI can do this for ~$0.01/minute

Why am I paying 1000x more? 🤔

(2/8)

---

So I built it myself:

• Whisper STT (transcription)
• GPT-4 (translation) 
• OpenAI TTS (voice output)

Total time: 2 weeks
Total cost to build: $0 (used Claude + Cursor)
Monthly API costs: ~$5

(3/8)

---

First test call:

Me speaking English → Spanish supplier hears Spanish
They speak Spanish → I hear English

Both in real-time on the same Zoom call

It actually worked. I was shaking.

(4/8)

---

Added features:

✅ 15 languages (not just Spanish)
✅ Host/Guest model (guests join via link, no account)
✅ 15 min free trial
✅ $29/month for unlimited

ROI for me: $480 → $29 = $451 saved/month

(5/8)

---

Lessons learned:

1. Ship fast. Perfect is the enemy of done.
2. Build for yourself = you understand the pain
3. Simple pricing wins (one tier, clear value)
4. Security matters (rate limiting, abuse prevention)

(6/8)

---

Tech stack for the curious:

Frontend: Vanilla JS (kept it simple)
Backend: FastAPI + WebSockets
Auth: Google OAuth
Payments: Stripe
DB: PostgreSQL (Neon)
APIs: OpenAI (Whisper, GPT, TTS)

Now what?

Need 10 brave souls to test it and tell me what sucks.

I'll give you free access for honest feedback.

Title: Launched my first SaaS after wasting $480 on interpreters this month

Body:

Background: I run a small import/export business and work with Spanish suppliers weekly.

Problem: Every Zoom call needed an interpreter at $80/hour. Last month's invoice hit $480 for just 6 calls.

Solution: Spent 2 weeks building LiveTranslateAI - real-time AI translation for video calls.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Vanilla JS (WebSockets for real-time audio)
- Backend: FastAPI + Python
- APIs: OpenAI (Whisper STT, GPT translation, TTS)
- Auth: Google OAuth
- Payments: Stripe

Key features:
✓ Real-time translation during video calls
✓ Host/Guest model (guests join via link, no signup)
✓ 15 languages supported
✓ 15 min free, then $29/month

Lessons learned:
1. MVP in 2 weeks is possible if you stay focused
2. Build for yourself = you deeply understand the problem
3. Security is hard (rate limiting, abuse prevention, fingerprinting)
4. Stripe webhooks are finicky but critical

Already saved myself $450/month. Now opening it up for beta testers.

Looking for honest feedback - what would you want to see in a tool like this?

## **COPY-PASTE TEMPLATES**

### **When Someone DMs About Your Product:**
```
Thanks for the interest! Here's the link: livetranslateai.com

It's $29/mo after 15 free minutes, but if you give me 
feedback on your first call, I'll extend you to 30 min free.

What's your use case? (Tutoring, business, family?)
```

### **When Someone Says "Too Expensive":**
```
Totally understand! Quick question: How much do you currently 
spend on interpreters per month?

Most of our customers were spending $80-200/hour on human 
interpreters. $29/month = unlimited calls vs 20 minutes with 
a human.

But if budget is tight, happy to work something out for early adopters!
```

### **When Someone Asks Technical Questions:**
```
Great question! 

Tech stack:
- STT: OpenAI Whisper
- Translation: GPT-3.5-turbo
- TTS: OpenAI TTS
- Accuracy: ~95% (great for business, not legal/medical)
